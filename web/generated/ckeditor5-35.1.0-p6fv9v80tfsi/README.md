# CKEditor 5 editor generated with the online builder

### Installation

In order to rebuild the application you need to install all dependencies first. To do it, open the terminal in the project directory and type:

```
npm install
```

Make sure that you have the `node` and `npm` installed first. If not, then follow the instructions on the [Node.js documentation page](https://nodejs.org/en/).

### Rebuilding editor

If you have already done the [Installation](#installation) steps, you're ready to rebuild the editor by running the following command:

```
npm run build
```

This will build the CKEditor 5 to the `build` directory. You can open your browser and you should be able to see the changes you've made in the code. If not, then try to refresh also the browser cache by typing `Ctrl + R` or `Cmd + R` depending on your system.

## What's next?

Add the finished build as a dependency to the /web module.
